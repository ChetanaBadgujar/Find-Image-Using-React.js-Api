# First ReactJs Project - ContactDetails Form
## Project Description

Creating an applicatin in React is quite tough, but still I am loving it.
Here are the brief Description of my first React.js Project: 

1. It is a simple contact details form. In this form I am adding only name and email field of the user with the help of localStorage in Javascript. LocalStorage is the way to save our data after the logout from the application or the computer.
 
2. Technology - React.js Framework of JavaScript and the package uuid for generating unique id for every user details.

3. I faced a bit challenges in this project. The challenge is that UseEffect Hook that will reder the component again and again without the passing dependency into it.
And another mistakes is the silly  mistakes ðŸ˜€.
